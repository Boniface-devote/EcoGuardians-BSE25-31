**Eco-Guardians: Waste Warriors of Uganda**

Eco-Guardians: Waste Warriors of Uganda is an offline educational mobile game developed by BSE 25-31, a team of Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering students at Makerere University’s School of Computing and Informatics Technology. Built with Unity 6 and C#, the game immerses players in a 3D Ugandan market to learn waste management through sorting and community education. Targeting Android 9.0+ and Windows 10+ platforms, it promotes environmental awareness among schoolchildren and communities in Uganda.

**Overview**
Eco-Guardians educates players on proper waste management through two engaging levels:

Level 1: Sort waste into six categories (Plastics, Organic, Paper, Metal, Glass, Hazardous) using intuitive controls.
Level 2: Educate non-playable characters (NPCs) and collect waste via a truck to clean the market.

The game operates offline, storing progress locally in savegame.json and PlayerPrefs, and is optimized for low-end devices to ensure accessibility. It supports touch (Android) and mouse/keyboard (Windows) inputs, with a heads-up display (HUD) showing real-time metrics like Score and Correct Disposals.
